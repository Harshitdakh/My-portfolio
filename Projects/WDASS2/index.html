                Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday attacked the opposition in Maharashtra, accusing them of having
                a problem with "Sambhaji Maharaj's name".

                Addressing an election rally in the poll-bound state, the prime minister said those who see their
                "messiah" in the person who killed the Maratha warrior-king are standing against the state and Maratha
                pride.


                "Those who have a problem with Sambhaji Maharaj's name, those who see Messiah in the name of those who
                killed him, aren't they standing against the Maharashtra and Maratha pride? Aren't these people against
                our identity? Will Maharashtra ever accept such people?" he said while addressing a rally in Chhatrapati
                Sambhajinagar.

                Sambhaji Maharaj was the son of Maratha icon Chhatrapati Shivaji. He was killed by the Mughal emperor
                Aurangzeb.

                PM Modi also attacked the Congress, saying it is against reservation and development.

                "To form the government, the Congress party believes in division and not development... From the
                beginning, Congress has been against reservation... Old advertisements which are going viral on the
                internet nowadays show the real thinking of Congress regarding reservations. Congress used to call
                reservations against the country and merit. Congress' mentality and agenda remain the same, even today.
                Hence, from the last 10 years, it is tough for them to tolerate a PM from the OBC," he added.


                He said the Mahayuti government renamed Aurangabad as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar and fulfilled Shiv Sena
                founder Balasaheb Thackeray's wish.

                PM Modi said the Congress and its allies want the restoration of Article 370 and are planning a separate
                constitution for Jammu and Kashmir..</div><br>

                New Delhi: Delhi's air quality remained in the 'severe' category for a second day on Thursday, with low
                wind
                speed contributing to a thick fog layer across the national capital. However, Environment Minister Gopal
                Rai
                confirmed that the third phase of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP 3) will not be imposed for now.
                "For the last two days, for the first time this season, AQI has gone above 400 in Delhi. Many people
                have
                questions in their minds about why the AQI which was in the 'poor' or 'very poor' category since October
                14
                suddenly went into the 'severe' category. Meteorologists have reported that due to snowfall in the
                mountains, a drop in the temperature of Delhi has been recorded. Due to this, dry conditions have been
                created in the morning and evening in the entirety of North India," Mr Rai said.

                According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) was measured at
                428
                at 9 am, placing it in the 'severe' category. Of Delhi's 39 monitoring stations, 32 recorded AQI levels
                over
                400, including Anand Vihar, IGI Airport, Mandir Marg, and Patparganj. This marks Delhi's worst air
                quality
                reading of the season and the highest in the country, with a 24-hour AQI of 418 on Wednesday, an
                increase
                from 334 the day prior.

                Nitin Gadkari said he was sure that there will be a definite victory for the Mahayuti and our government
                will be formed in Maharashtra
                NEW DELHI: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari was in conversation with
                Hindustan Times’ national political editor and bureau chief Sunetra Choudhury at an online session of
                the 22nd Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. Their conversation spanned infrastructure, environment, and
                the politics of his home state, Maharashtra, which goes to polls on November 20.

                How much are roads a factor for voters in an election?
                A country where water, power, transport and communication are developed attracts capital investment
                which leads to an increase in industries, trade and business. Per capita income increases and poverty
                reduces. Therefore, better infrastructure is important for the country’s development and progress. For
                example, we reconstructed the old highway between Delhi and Dehradun which increased the number of
                pilgrims by 2.5 times. This led to the creation of a (business) ecosystem of taxis, buses, restaurants
                and hotels and created employment.
                When we build roads, it brings industries and townships. My ministry has taken two initiatives to work
                towards the development of the country. We are making 36 green express highways which will shorten the
                by-road distance. We have built the access control green express highway from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and
                also increased the capacity of the existing roads. The second initiative taken was to prioritise biofuel
                and alternative fuel in place of petrol and diesel, therefore, we have encouraged ethanol, methanol,
                bio-diesel, bio-LNG, bio-CNG, electric and hydrogen. Through these initiatives, we will definitely bring
                down the current logistic cost from 14-16% to a single-digit value. We can become more competitive in
                the export market. Our exports will increase by 1.5 times and I believe these two initiatives will be
                helpful in realising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aspiration to become a 5 trillion dollar, as well as
                the world’s third-largest economy.
                Do you think that there is a disadvantage to the multi-modal development which is causing damage to
                ecosensitive areas and how will you balance that out?
                This insinuation is completely wrong. You tell me when it took nine hours to reach Dehradun from Delhi
                burning fossil fuel (petrol and diesel), how much pollution was it causing? And now that electric and
                bio-fuel vehicles will be driven, how much less pollution will it create? The time that will be saved
                will also lead to less pollution and savings on fuel which will also be cost effective. Secondly, isn’t
                it important to increase the number of tourists in the country for its development? Such thinking
                doesn’t prevail anywhere else in the world.
